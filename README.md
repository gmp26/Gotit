Gotit - guess in turn to reach a target
=======================================

Designed to support creative maths.

Take turns to add numbers to hit a target number.

Getting Started (Developers)
---

Install [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), then:

```
git clone https://github.com/gmp26/DottyGrid.git
cd Gotit
npm install && bower install
grunt server
```

The third step downloads and compiles development dependencies so you will see
a lot of network traffic.

Chrome will open pointing to a copy of the animation at http://localhost:9000.

Notes
---

* `grunt server:dist` will create a publication ready, minified and optimised distribution in dist.
* This animation uses Bootstrap v3 and Angular-ui/bootstrap-bower latest.
